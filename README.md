Practicing web scraping methods, scraped a table full of data from wikipedia 

After spending a decent amount of my time in my undergrad working with data problems (mostly learning R and Python for data analysis) I figured it was time to learn how to collect my own data - as a csv from the professor or Kaggle won't magically appear in real life problems.

By using BeautifulSoup in Python, after a decent amount of debugging, I was able to scrape the desired table from Wikipedia. 

I wanted to get a quick dive in to the biggest startups in the world, and who was making noise, now that I've collected the raw data from Wikipedia by scraping it, and saved it into csv format, it is ready for data analysis.
